# Network Scurity



## Confidentiality(Cryptography)

only sender, intended receiver should “understand” message contents

– sender encrypts message

– receiver decrypts message

* symmetric - key cryptography

* asymmetric - key cryptography.

## Authentication

Entity authentication is a technique designed to let one party prove the identity of another party. An entity can be a person, a process, a client, or a server. 

The entity whose identity needs to be proved is called the claimant; 
the party that tries to prove the identity of the claimant is called the verifier.

## Message Integrity

**Digital signature** does not provide privacy. If there is a need for privacy, another layer of encryption/decryption must be applied.

## Key Distribution and certification





## Access control : firewalls



## Attacks and counter measures



## Security in many layers



## VPN

* Virtual Private Network (VPN) is defined as network connectivity deployed on a shared infrastructure with the same policies and security as a private network.
* A VPN can be between two end systems, or it can be between two or more networks.
* A VPN can be built using tunnels and encryption. VPNs can occur at any layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack.

* A VPN is an alternative WAN infrastructure that replaces or augments existing private networks that use leased-line or enterprise-owned networks

**VPNs provide three critical functions:**

* Confidentiality (encryption) – The sender can encrypt the packets before transmitting them across a network.

* Data integrity – The receiver can verify that the data was transmitted through the Internet without being altered.

* Origin authentication – The receiver can authenticate the source of the packet, guaranteeing and certifying the source of the information.

* Access Control: Restricting unauthorized users from the network
